// This is the example code for two (three) operations that are essential to Linked Lists that we went over in session.
// I will not explain any of the code, rather you will look at it and **DRAW** it out and form your own understanding
// You are given permission to take *Inspiration* from and/or "copy" (without copy pasting) this code under two conditions:
	// *** You need to be able to explain what the code is doing either in a high-end level perspective or line-by-line. ***
		// If you can't, but you copy this code anyways, it will be considered academic dishonesty.
	// You will need to be able to implement it yourself by coding it *WITHOUT* looking at this code.
// Copying doesn’t help you, especially if you can’t understand and learn from it. You will only suffer in the long run by doing this.
