# CS10BW2023
## GitHub for SI
There's quite a lot with GitHub that is really important to know. The first and foremost is the fact that GitHub uses this thing called `git`. From your terminal you will do everything through this `git` command. These commands will be explained in the **[Using GitHub](https://github.com/PikaSannnnn/CS10BW2023#using-github)** section.  
The main importance in this section is how GitHub will be used for SI. From now on, what you'll do when coming to session is to open this GitHub and stay on the main page. Likewise, open your version of the repository that is on either your local machine or the cs010b server. You will be coding using the template files that I provide or we will continue with a previous activity.  

**Make sure that you are ALWAYS working on your own branch.**

I will also be putting solutions to the code to practice activities that we *have gone over and have already seen the solution in session*.
 
## Setting up a GitHub Key
Whenever you wish to push something, you have to login. As of 2020, for absolutely no reason, you cannot use your own GitHub password anymore. Instead, you have to use a token key. You can go (here)[https://docs.github.com/en/authentication/keeping-your-account-and-data-secure/creating-a-personal-access-token] to setup a key. Keep this safe with you at all times; otherwise, you'll have to keep making new keys, and no one likes that.  

The other option is to permanently link a specific server by generating a ssh key:
1. You can do this by typing `ssh-keygen -t rsa` to generate a key pair  
2. Get the key generated by typing and copying the output from `cat ~/.ssh/id_rsa.pub`
3. Next, copy the content of this file. Go to GitHub -> settings -> SSH and GPG keys. 
Click “New SSH key”. Paste the public key into field “Key”, and give it a name you like.
4. With this, you can now just `git clone <ssh link>` and similar git commands easily as long as you used the **ssh link** (which can be found in the same green "code" button, but under the `ssh` tab instead.
## Using GitHub

## Useful Commands:
### Compiling the Code
MacOS/Linux:  
```
g++ -std=c++17 main.cpp
```
Windows:  
```
g++ main.cpp
```
### Running the Code
MacOS/Linux:  
```
./a.out
```
Windows:  
```
a.exe
```

### Terminal Commands
* `pwd` - Print Working Directory: displays currently directory
* `ls` - List: lists directories and files in current director
  * Appending `-l` displays directories and files w/ permissions & last edit time
  * Appending `-a` displays all directories and files **including hidden files**
  * Appending `-la` or `al` combines the power of `-l` and `-a`
  * Appending a folder name (i.e. `ls home/` lists files in that directory without entering it)
* `cd` - Change Directory: changes working directory
  * `cd ..` exits current directory and enters previous direct
    * If you are in `home/homework`, typing `cd ..` will take you to `home/`
  * `cd` by itself or `cd ~` changes working directory to ROOT directory
  * Appending a directory path will take you directly to that directory
    * ex) `cd home/homework/CS10B` takes you to the CS10B folder in homework, which is in home
    * `..` can be used as well
      * ex) If you're in `home/homework/CS10B`, typing `cd ../../labs` will take you to the labs folder in `home`
* `mkdir` Creates a directory given a name
* `touch` Creates a file given a name (must include file type in name)
* `cp` Copies a file into a specified directory
  * ex) `cp main.cpp ../homework/CS10B`
* `rm` Removes a FILE
  * appending `-rf` will remove a FOLDER and all contents within (You don't get a confirmation message)
* `mv` Moves a file into a specified directory
  * ex) `mv main.cpp ../homework/CS110B`
  * Specifying another file name will *rename* the file
    * ex) `mv main.cpp run.cpp`
* `cat` Displays all contents within the specified file onto the terminal
* `nano` or `vim` Opens the specified file in an in-terminal file editor
  * Note: Nano is more simple than vim; vim focuses on keeping your hands on the home-row, which means your arrow movements use the homerow
* `g++ -Wall -Werror main.cpp -o run.out` Compiles a C++ code
  * `-Wall` tells compiler to display all warnings into the terminal
  * `-Werror` tells compiler to treat all warnings as errors
  * `-o` tells compiler to create executable using following argument
    * `-o run.out` creates a `run.out` executable rather than the default `a.out`


**Useful Tips**
* If you want to learn makefiles, you can go [here](https://makefiletutorial.com/). Makefiles are essential a script that compiles and sets up everything that is needed to create your runnable code.
* Compiling multiple files is like this: `g++ main.cpp a.cpp b.cpp`. If you know you want to compile every `.cpp` file in the directory, do this instead `g++ *.cpp`. `*` in CS is universal for "Everything", and doing `*.cpp` means "Everything with `.cpp` as the extention.


## File Streams
* `#include <fstream>` is needed to use the file stream
* `ifstream` is for inputting/reading from the file (similar to `cin`)
* `ofstream` is for outputting/writing to the file (similar to `cout`)
* `fstream` is the default (blank state) of `ofstream` and `ifstream`
    * A stream buffer labeled using `fstream` is by default bidirectional, you must declare a specific direction using a flag
* When opening a file flags can be set for the stream buffer.
  * ios::in - sets the stream buffer as input (default for ifstream)
  * ios::out - sets the stream buffer as output (default for ofstream)
  * ios::app - sets all output operations at the end of the file (append)
      * Only the operations are done at the end of the file
  * ios::ate - sets the output position at the end of the file
  * [Other Modes/Flags](http://www.cplusplus.com/reference/fstream/fstream/fstream/)
* Every file stream has its own methods (similar to string and vector)
  * `.open(<filename>, <flag(1) | flag(2) | ...>)`
      * Note: files can also be opened when declaring the stream buffer i.e. `ifstream fin(<filename>, <flag(1) | ...>)`
  * `.is_open()` returns false if file did not opene correctly or could not be opened, true otherwise
  * `.close()` closes the file and makes it available to use for other uses
  * `.ignore()` reads and ignores next input, or for parameters `(<max num char to skip>, <char to skip to>)`
  * `.eof()` checks if the eof bit was set
      * Note: Returns a bool, but is best **not** to be used with loops as bugs often occur
  * `.clear()` resets state bits
  * `.good()` returns true if good bit is 1
  * `.bad()` returns true if bad bit is 1
  * `.fail()` returns true if fail bit is 1
  
## Command Arguments
* To read arguments from command line `int argc, char* argv[]` must be set as `main()`'s parameters
  * Note: `char* argv[]` is interchangable with `char** argv`
  * When running the program, everything in the command line is read and stored in `argv[]`
  * `char* argv[]` is a c-string and behaves similar to strings included in `<string>`
  * `./a.out` will also be stored (as the first argument)
* Always check that there is enough arguments and/or the argument exists before trying to access it
